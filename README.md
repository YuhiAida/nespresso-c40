# Nespresso-c40
This project is based on a Nespresso C40 that it's motherboard was burn in a power outage. Due to the high price, no availability and shipping time in Argentina it's not worth repair it. So here I am.

**operation:**
Fist I didn't use the temperature sensor that comes with this machine, so be carefull, the heating element could result damage along with other plastic parts.

***Short coffee button:*** 
 - 1 click short coffee 80ml~
 - Press at least 1 sec. to fill pump(if the pump suck air).
 - 
***Large coffee button***
- 1 click large coffe
- 2 click pump wather without turning on the heating element(if you want "cold" coffe or cooling down the heating element for some reason)
- Press at least 1 sec will turn on the heating element for 4 seconds.

***The reset button:*** That it's outside the machine is used is you want to cancel something.
